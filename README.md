# Description
This week I setup a SQL database to manage all the data generated by the simulations. It is a simple relational database with a relation for the paramters under which the simualtion was run (essentially stores the information in the JSON file) and another relation for the data points in the simulation. This second relation stores the 6-vector describing the foot's state along with the time and the corresponding 3-vector GRF. I think the database will help manage the data as it grows. The initial conditions for the simulation that Juntao gave me took about 1.5 hours to run a 4-second simulation (on the GPU) so avoiding resimulating data is important. Last week we did talk about cutting down on the size and number of granular particles so that should help reduce the run time too.

I also worked on visualizing the data generated from the simulation.   


# Questions



# Next Week
Change parameters of granular material. Did Juntao find a better parameter? Work on visualization tool. Generate dataset?
