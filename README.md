# Questions
How to validate the model's gradient calculations? Is it possible for the model to have a high accuracy but the derivatives of the model be poor? I am guessing one could engineer a case where this is true but its probably unlikely to occur on its own? Its actually an interesting question on its own and I am curious to know. If this is not generally possible/likely to occur, we can probably assume that if the model has good predictive accuracy then it's derivatives will be relatively correct as well.

Fine tune the Matlab-Python interface. Generate dataset with more collisions with granular material. Build simple database to manage the data.
