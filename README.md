# Description
I spent this week learning about how to call Python code from Matlab. I put together a rough sketch of what the final API might look like. It lets Matlab use a tensorflow neural network. It also lets Matlab get the derivates of the output variables with respect to the input variables. I also spent time learning how to use Juntao's simulation of the foot contacting the granular material.  

# Tensorflow and Automatic Differentiation 
Insert pdf/image to help describe 
Explain why its better than normal numerical differentiation


# Persistent Storage of Data?
Since it requires a lot of time to run granular simulations, it probably makes sense to store the data in database to avoid resimulating any data. We could probably get away with just using .txt files but its probably worth the effort to use a real database. It will be easier to understand later and modify etc.
