# Description
This week I setup a SQL database to manage all the data generated by the simulations. It is a simple relational database with a relation for the paramters under which the simualtion was run (essentially stores the information in the JSON file) and another relation for the data points in the simulation. This second relation stores the 6-vector describing the foot's state along with the time and the corresponding 3-vector GRF. I think the database will help manage the data as it grows. The initial conditions for the simulation that Juntao gave me took about 1.5 hours to run a 4-second simulation (on the GPU) so avoiding resimulating data is important. Last week we did talk about cutting down on the size and number of granular particles so that should help reduce the run time too.

I also worked on visualizing the data generated from the simulation. I used Python and it's graphics library. Since this is a planar animation, I take the (angle of foot, foot's x position, foot's y-position) and use rotation matrices to rotate and translate the frame. At each time step I plot the center's of the foot's position as a red dot. A video of the foot translating along a sinusoidal path and rotating at constant angular velocity is at footRotating.mkv.

The first 0.5 seconds of the simulation have the foot stand still and wait for the granular material to settle. I then animated the first 0.5 second of the foot movingafter that and obtained the following. An image is below

# Questions



# Next Week
Change parameters of granular material. Did Juntao find a better parameter? Work on visualization tool. Generate dataset?
